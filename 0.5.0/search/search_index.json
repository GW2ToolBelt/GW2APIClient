The entire API surface has been touched up and improved to provide a better developer experience.</p> <p>The most significant change is the decoupling of request creation from request execution:</p> <pre><code>// Old\nsuspend fun main() {\n  val client = GW2APIClient(...)\n  val requestBuilder = client.gw2v2Build()\n\n  val request = coroutineScope { requestBuilder.execute(this) }\n  val response = request.get()\n\n  val gw2v2Build = response.data.getOrNull() ?: error(\"Could not decode request\")\n\n  println(\"Build ID: ${gw2v2Build.id}\")\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Whereas the old way to create request contained a lot of ceremony to support asynchronous and synchronous execution at the same time, the new way is much more straightforward:</p> <pre><code>// New\nsuspend fun main() {\n  val client = Gw2ApiClient()\n  val gw2v2Build = client.executeAsync(gw2v2Build()).dataOrNull ?: error(\"Failed to fetch build ID.\")\n\n  println(\"Build ID: {$gw2v2Build.id}\")\n}\n</code></pre> <p>There is no full migration guide available.
