#### Overview

**GW2APIClient** is a cross-platform client for the official Guild Wars 2 API.
By leveraging [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html),
GW2APIClient can be used on a large variety of platforms (including Android, the
JVM, and JS) and interoperates seamlessly with various popular programming
languages.

GW2APIClient provides low-level access to the data provided by Guild Wars 2's
API. It does not provide higher-level abstractions, visualizations or analytical
functionality but may be used to build such tools.
